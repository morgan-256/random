Hello JTS team,

I started using the JuggernautAI app a couple weeks ago and wanted to share my thoughts on it so far. I couldn't find a way to send a long letter privately to you, so I've opted to just create this file and send you a link :)

First, I'll tell you a bit about myself. I'm a 43yo male, 185lbs with some chronic health issues (I'm also in software development). I've been on-and-off powerlifting for 6 years (due to health issues), so I've mostly been in a  perpetual novice phase. I started with StrongLifts and moved to Madcow but found it far too taxing, and decided to try JuggernautAI. So in otherwords I'm an ameteur and not sure if I'll ever go to a powerlifting meet. It's almost embarrassing to say but I have not done any variation exercises or 1RM attempts in the past 6 years. I work out solo at home, never used a trainer, and have just learned everything on my own.

JuggernautAI has been eye-opening and it's re-invigorated my training. I'm super excited to for the plan including trying hypertrophy phases and all these variations to fix weak spots and to actually do 10RPE attempts.

I am questioning if I am the right target audience for the app. On one hand it seems to be targeted towards experienced lifters that intend to go to meets, but on the other hand it seems almost like a great introduction to that next-level world after ultra simple novice training (i.e. Starting Strength/StrongLifts).

So I wanted to send you this message to possibly help understand my 'persona' -
