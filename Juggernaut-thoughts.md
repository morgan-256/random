Hello JTS team,

I started using the JuggernautAI app a couple weeks ago and wanted to share my thoughts on it so far. I couldn't find a way to send a long letter privately to you, so I've opted to just create this file and send you a link :)

First, I'll tell you a bit about myself. I'm a 43yo male, 185lbs with some chronic health issues (I'm also in software development). I've been on-and-off powerlifting for 6 years (due to health issues), so I've mostly been in a  perpetual novice phase. I started with StrongLifts and moved to Madcow but found it far too taxing, and decided to try JuggernautAI. So in otherwords I'm an ameteur and not sure if I'll ever go to a powerlifting meet. It's almost embarrassing to say but I have not done any variation exercises or 1RM attempts in the past 6 years. I work out solo at home, never used a trainer, and have just learned everything on my own. Although I have become a moderator on the (Reddit forum for stronglifts)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Stronglifts5x5/] (more on this later).

JuggernautAI has been eye-opening and it's re-invigorated my training. I'm super excited to for the plan including trying hypertrophy phases and all these variations to fix weak spots and to actually do 1RM attempts in 6 months from now.

I have questioned though, if I am the right target audience for the app. On one hand it seems to be targeted towards experienced lifters that intend to go to meets, that are already experienced with certain techniques and terminology, and it's 'expensive' for an app, but on the other hand it seems almost like a great introduction to that next-level world after ultra-simple novice training (i.e. Starting Strength/StrongLifts).

So I wanted to send you this message to possibly help understand my 'persona' because I think the app is quite genius and ground-breaking, and has ridicously huge potential. Selling templates online has been popular for many years now and I'm sure are successful for some, but using technology to build a 'living' program like you have done is the next evolution, IMO. I guess there's others out there doing it as well, but to me there's a level of popularity that can be broken through still. If you are open to this, here's what I would suggest for expanding the features of the app:

* allow for different tiers of pricing. I'm willing to pay $40 (Canadian) but I've seen many comments that it's just too steep for some. Perhaps a tier for someone like me that is never intending to go to meets?
* include more features for beginners - Stronglifts has a pretty nice app that has a warmup set calculator and plate calcuator. Maybe I'm out of my depth on this one, and sure it seems simple to calculate warmups for a set of 5 if your doing a 500 lb squat, but for me, I am a bit clueless on how to warmup for, say, a set of 8 reps spoto press at 135-145 lbs (my session today)
* I *love* that the app has the little i icons for help. They are everywhere, but I've found a couple things hard to figure out like technique sets. I think the "Exercises" section could be expanded to a "library" or something that includes exercises but also all the terminology referenced throughout the app. But the content you guys have out there (youtube, FAQ on site) is great. I'm just saying consolidate it all into the app for the highest convenience.
